Since the dataset is uncleaned, here are the key areas you should clean:

1. Missing Values
Customer Name: Some names are missing (""). You can:
Fill missing names with "Unknown Customer"
Remove rows with missing names if necessary
Price: Some prices are None. You can:
Fill with the average or median price of the same product
Remove rows with missing prices if they are critical
Delivery Date: Some are missing (""). You can:
Fill with an estimated delivery date based on the order date
Mark as "Pending" if delivery is not yet completed

2. Incorrect or Inconsistent Data
Product Name: Some values are "UNKNOWN". You can:
Replace "UNKNOWN" with "Miscellaneous Item"
Investigate if they match existing products
Payment Status: Inconsistent values like "Completed" and "Paid". You can:
Standardize these (e.g., "Paid" for completed transactions)
Group similar statuses together ("Processing" â†’ "Pending")

3. Formatting Issues
Order Date: Some dates are in the wrong format. You should:
Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
Customer Email: Some values are "invalid_email". You should:
Remove or replace them with "unknown@example.com"

4. Outliers and Logical Errors
Quantity: Some values are unusually high (10-100). Check if they are valid or errors.
Delivery Date: Some might be before the Order Date, which is impossible. Fix these.
